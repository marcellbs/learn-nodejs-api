# Learn Node JS API 

This repository is used to store code from learning APIs that come from [Devtamins](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OfL9H6AmhQ&t=1904s) YouTube channels.
I have refactored the previous version, and divided it into MVC concepts so that the code is easy to read and understand

some things that have been learned are :
- [x] Get Data from Database
- [x] Post Data to Database
- [x] Delete Data from Database
- [x] Update Data from Database

and also the technology used is
- [x] Node JS
- [x] Express JS
- [x] MongoDB
